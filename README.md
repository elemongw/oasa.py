# oasa.py


oasa.py is meant to be used both interactively and non-interactively. It is meant to wrap the OASA API to provide both an interactive tool and pythonized API. Simplicity comes first so things that can be accomplished with the GNU toolchain will noted be added, for example:

> watch -n 10 oasa.py
